		- ## CIF unsuited for containerized cargo
		  
		  Unlike some other Incoterms, the risk transfer point of the CIF Incoterm is not the same point as the cost transfer point. With CIF, risk is transferred only when the goods are loaded on board the ship at origin.
		  This makes CIF unsuitable for containerized cargo, which is usually dropped off at terminal days prior to loading. This creates a grey area during which cargo could unknowingly suffer damages.
		  Given the nature of containerized cargo, which remains unopened until destination, it would be nearly impossible to know when merchandise gets damaged in the event that it does. When dealing with containerized cargo, CIP is the recommended alternative to CIF.
