		- ## CIF unsuited for containerized cargo
		  
		  Unlike some other Incoterms, the risk transfer point of the CIF Incoterm is not the same point as the cost transfer point. With CIF, risk is transferred only when the goods are loaded on board the ship at origin.
		  This makes CIF unsuitable for containerized cargo, which is usually dropped off at terminal days prior to loading. This creates a grey area during which cargo could unknowingly suffer damages.
		  Given the nature of containerized cargo, which remains unopened until destination, it would be nearly impossible to know when merchandise gets damaged in the event that it does. When dealing with containerized cargo, CIP is the recommended alternative to CIF.

- [[客户交流]]2021年12月， [[凯莱英]] 的王莹联系我们（中凯垫资），买了165kg哒嗪，地址是河北维智达美，凯莱英的合作工厂。此后，王莹这里没有项目后续。今年3-4月， [[常州中凯]] 直接联系我们，拿过1.5kg和500g 哒嗪样品，说是天津凯莱英的其他项目，收件人是天津凯莱英的王明慧。后来就没后续了。
- DONE ROS考虑是否给客户，终端是DIVIS。客户自己给了原料，询问是否正确。
