- Hi Francois,
- Our team has preliminary reviewed this request and some comments have been made. Since Christmas is coming, and our Spring Festival also lasts from Jan. 15 to Feb. 15, we better discuss this through these two days.
- First, the dangerous type is categorized by Chinese customs. We cannot promise that the government office would agree to change the hazardous type. Kindly note that we've been exporting this product under class 9 for many years and no news for updating since now.
- Second, I understand that you are not worried about the ETD. However, the ETD in Jan is important as we also consolidate with Cyromazine. Our current low price for Cyromazine is based on this consol with Azamethiphos in Jan.
- Third, we have offered pretty low price for Azamethiphos, too. The current exchange rate is not optimistic, however we are lucky to have locked a high rate with the bank, but we need to receive the payment before May. 15.

- If we are to change the hazardous type, which we cannot ensure, the EDT is very likely to be later than Feb.15. So if there's any chance you could solve the import problem and let us export under class 9, please let us know. Otherwise, the ETA could be later than you expect and our favorable prices are difficult to maintain...
