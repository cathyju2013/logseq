- Hi Francois,

- Our team has preliminary reviewed this request and some comments have been made. Since Christmas is coming, and our Spring Festival also lasts from Jan. 15 to Feb. 10 (workers get back to factory later during pandemic), we better discuss this through these two days.
-
- First, the dangerous type is categorized by Chinese customs, therefore we cannot promise that we can export under a new hazardous type. Actually we factories do not have this choice to change the type by ourselves. Otherwise, the transport for dangerous goods can be a mess.

- Second, as we have been exporting this substance under class 9 for many years, if we change the type, many administration work shall be done. For now we are not sure how much work here. So the preparation time can be longer than you thought.

- Third, our current low price for Cyromazine is based on this consol with Azamethiphos with ETD from Jan. to Feb. With the dangerous type changed, the ETD could be later, and it is hard to find a mixing container for the new types, which I am still checking with shipping lines.
