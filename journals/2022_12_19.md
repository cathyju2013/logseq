	- Hi Francois,
	-
	- Could you kindly indicate why it is a must for you to import Azamethiphos under class 6.1, UN3464? This helps us to know better your request and make solutions.
	-
	- We've been exporting this substance under class 9 for many years. If we have to transport under a new type, a lot of work needs to be done, including getting a new identification report issued by Chinese Customs Technology Center. However, we are not sure if they could change the identification result...
	-
	- All the preparation work takes much time and may cause loss to both of our sides. For instance, it may yinfluence the consol with Cyromazine, as its stock is tight.
	-
	- Therefore, we sincerely hope to export Azamethiphos under class 9 this time and fulfill the consol as scheduled.
	-
	- I await your response.
	-
	- Many thanks!

	- Second, as we have been exporting this substance under class 9 for many years, if we change the dangerous type, many administration work for factories shall be done according to government policies. The preparation time can be longer than we thought.

	- Above problems take time to figure out and might cause trouble for both sides. So, please let me know if we can export under class 9 for this time. And we can discuss the change in a long term and get everything prepared.
	- Since Christmas is coming, and our Spring Festival also lasts from Jan. 15 to Feb. 10 (workers get back to factory later during pandemic), we better talk about this these two days.
	- I await your response.
