- Hi Francois,
-
- Our team has preliminary reviewed this request and some comments have been made. Since Christmas is coming, and our Spring Festival also lasts from Jan. 15 to Feb. 10 (workers get back to factory later during pandemic), we better talk about this these two days.
-
- First, the dangerous type is categorized by Chinese customs technology center, therefore we cannot promise that we can export under a new hazardous type. Actually, we factories do not have this choice to change it by ourselves. Otherwise, the transport for dangerous goods can be a mess.
-
- Second, as we have been exporting this substance under class 9 for many years, if we change the dangerous type, many administration work for factories shall be done according to government policies. For now we are not sure how much time it will take. But it can be much longer than you thought.
-
- Third, our current low price for Cyromazine is based on this consol with Azamethiphos with ETD from Jan. to Feb. With the dangerous type changed, the ETD could be later, and less choices for shipping lines to ship these two products together.
-
- Above problems take time to figure out and might cause trouble for both sides. So, if any chance we can export under class 9 for this time, please let us know. Otherwise, many details shall be re-discussed, which we definitely don't want to.
-
- I await your response.
