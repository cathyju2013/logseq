	- 1.1 客户为什么总是嫌价格高？如何应对？[[2022-08-01]]
		- （1）心态调整。当你准备好了，你会期待；当你没准备好，你会逃避。要了解自己的价格在行业内（全球范围）的水平。
		- （2）挖掘更多的信息。学会问问题，让客户提供更多信息。如By how much?
		- （3）阐释总成本优势。 [[邮件内容]] Let's focus on the total cost. I'll break all the all the major factors and discuss what we can do to lower your cost. 附上照片，解释我们有Factory Direct Local Inventory. Domestic Customer Service & Parts Support.
			- There are many people can put the money down, but not many of them can roll their sleeves up.
		- （4）验证真实性和迫切性。 [[邮件内容]]
			- “如果我行，你行不行？” How soon we can seal the deal if I can match the price?
			- “我也行，但是我不想。” Don't get me wrong. I love making money but there is no way I will lower our/my quality standard.
			- “我现在不行，但是我可能能行，你稍等我一下行不行？” I am currently working on a similar order. I might be able to get better pricing on certain parts based on the quantity of two  orders.
		- （5）Keep the ball rolling. [[邮件内容]]
			- We appreciate the opportunity you have given us. I know it's a time-consuming thing to select the right supplier.  Let's put the order aside, I just want to let you know  I am always here if you have any questions in the future.
	- 1.2 为什么发了500封开发信只收到15封回复？[[2022-08-01]]
		- （1）Your email sucks! 每一封不够好的邮件被客人打开，就是一次机会的浪费。
		- （2）It's not about you! [[邮件内容]]
			- I want to pitch you with our product ***. After researching your product line for like 40 minutes, I believe we can definitely make you more money.
			- Here is a sneak peek of my plan ( see, I don't want to waste your time.)
			- 1. ...
			  2. ...
			  Let's Keep the ball rolling if you are interested.
			- Thank you for your time.
		- （3）Your email list sucks! 客户清单质量不好，影响转化率。
		- [[鸡汤]]Find yourself before you look for someone else.
	- 1.3 和客户谈得好好的，为什么突然消失了？
		- (Smile and) Walk Away Method 这个方法是很多采购喜欢用的方法。
			- (1) The bait 让供应商以为可以马上下单
			- (2) Wait 24 hours. Ignore any emails they send during this time.
			- (3) Ask for final prices.
		- 如何应对The walk away method?
			- 不要出现情绪描述：You haven't responded to my privious email yet.
			- (1)得体询问跟进法 [[邮件内容]] ：
				- I know you are busy. I don't want to be annoying. (I don't want to be pushy.)
				- Just want to let you know I could be reached 24/7. And I'll email you once in a while.
				- Feel free to hit me up if you need anything.
			- (2)去除销售过程中的猜测
		- [[鸡汤]] If you want your voice to be heard, make it worth hearing.
	- 1.4 为什么我按照7-7-7跟踪客户，客户还是没有给我下单？（这个方法并不好）
		- (1) 通过跟踪客户，从客户身上获得有价值的信息。从客户A身上获得的有价值的信息，可以帮助你从客户B拿到订单。有助于提升市场开发能力。思考如何优化，了解更多信息。
		- (2) 结合客户动态跟踪客户。要了解客户在这个阶段发生了什么，放进跟踪邮件里面。比如，客户在领英、Instagram上面更新了动态。
		- (3) 每次跟踪客户，都要尽量为客户提供价值。
		- [[邮件内容]]
			- Hi Rory,
			- It's 11:02 pm Thursday night. I've been studying the scooter market for a couple of hours tonight.
			- According to Google, the consumers from Salt Lake City is top in search for the keyword "Gas Scooter". And Denver is on top four cities in search for the keyword "49cc scooter". ( I am attaching you these two screenshots.)
			- I know you've been getting lots of offers from different vendors. No matter what I have to do, I'll try my best to  have our scooters sold in your Salt Lake City and Denver stores.
			- Please let me know how to bring our business to a new level this year.
			- Talk to you soon.
		- (4) 其他跟踪客户的方法
			- 社交媒体跟踪
			- 订购小礼物给客户，附上留言卡片
		- [[鸡汤]] Motivated by the fear of being average.
	- 1.5 为什么我的订单越来越小，怎样才能找到大客户？
		- 问题在于，平时没有关注没给订单的B、C、D级别的客户。导致当市场格局变化时，后知后觉。对同一个生态内的竞争情况做好了解。
		- 从供应链角度思考如何找大客户？
			- 客户类型和订单流向
				- Factory
				- Distributor
				- Wholesalers
				- Retailers
			- 如果打破供应链，Wholesalers和Retailers都卖的话，就找不到Distributor。特别是美国这样的国家，他们的供应链非常成熟，如果你这样做，Distributor不会给你订单，不如选一个听话的Factory。
